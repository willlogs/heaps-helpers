# Heaps.io Basecode

This is a base code for heaps.io that I used in a series of tutorials:
youtube.com/c/theboywhomakesgames

It is currently subject to huge changes for the new series of tutorials.

There is not gonna be no physics library binding bcz I don't find that more fun than writing my own physics, but anyway, you can do that and submit a pull request. I'll be more than happy to accept that!
